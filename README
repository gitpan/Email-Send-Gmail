                  password => 'XXX',
              ]

DESCRIPTION
    Gmail is a free Web-based email service provided by Google. This module
    is a mailer for "Email::Send" that sends a message using Gmail's
    authenticated SSL SMTP service. You must have a Gmail account and you
    should send emails 'From' that account.

    You should pass in the username and password for the Gmail account.
    Sending emails can fail for many reasons and this module croaks upon any
    errors.

  ENVELOPE GENERATION
    The envelope sender and recipients are, by default, generated by looking
    at the From, To, Cc, and Bcc headers. This behavior can be modified by
    replacing the "get_env_sender" and "get_env_recipients" methods, both of
    which receive the Email::Simple object and their only parameter, and
    return email addresses.
